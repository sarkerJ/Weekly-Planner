## Project-Goal

The project goal is to create an application that allows users to manage their weekly activities/tasks. Users will have the ability to add new task to the planner and modify them later depending on their circumstances. They can also delete them and filter through the activities when necessary. 

The application will then be extended to include a notes feature where the user can create a new notes and rank them based on their priorities. Furthermore the notes can also be set to specific days so that they differentiate further from notes they may have taken throughout the week.
